# COMP2611-2020

This repository contains lab material for Data Structures at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine. Note that this repository created for code sharing convenience, and all solutions may be redacted at the end of the academic year in 2021.

## Week 1 (September 14th and 16th)

Review of linked lists, stacks and queues.

## Week 2 (September 21st and 23rd)

More practice with linked lists, stacks and queues (including recursive problems).

## Week 3 (September 28th and 30th)

Practice with recursive problems and merge operations on arrays, and storing structs in linked lists. 

## Week 4 (October 5th and 7th)

Practice with Binary Trees (traversals and other recursive functions).

## Week 5 (October 12th and 14th)

More practice with Binary Trees (non-recursive traversals and binary search trees). 

**No code updates posted after this week**. See [MyElearning](myelearning.sta.uwi.edu) for all other tutorial content.

## Week 6 (October 19th and 21st)

More practice with Binary Search Trees (in order predecessor/successor and level order traversal).

## Week 7 (October 26th and 28th)

Practice with Heaps (building heaps, and using heaps to sort arrays).

## Week 8 (November 2nd and 4th)

Practice with sorting algorithms (including heap, insertion, merge and quick sorts). A review of Assignment 1 was also done.

## Week 9 (November 9th and 11th)

Practice with Priority Queues and an introduction to Graphs (adjacency lists and matrices and the concept of vertices and edges).

## Week 10 (November 16th and 18th)

More practice with Graphs (adding and deleting edges, checking for edges and vertices, etc.). A review of Assignment 2 was also done.

## Week 11 (November 23rd and 25th)

More practice with Graphs (traversals and Dijkstra's minimum cost path algorithm).

## Week 12 (November 30th and December 2nd)

Practice with hashing techniques (hash tables and hash functions, collisions and techniques to resolve collisions). A review of some past paper questions was also done.
